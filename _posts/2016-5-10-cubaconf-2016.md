Hi there :+1:! We have some exciting news to share.

Last April's week we went to the first ever international Free Software
conference in Cuba: [CubaConf 2016](http://cubaconf.org/). We joined about 200 persons from 17
countries for three days of keynotes, [unconferences](http://www.bootev.org/what-is-an-unconference/), workshops,
hackathons, lightning (5 minutes) talks and coffee, a lot of coffee. At
the end of the days we had really fine meals, and the last day we also
enjoyed [mojitos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojito).

The event was organized by [Grupo de Usuarios de Tecnolog√≠as Libres](http://gutl.jovenclub.cu/
)
(GUTL) from Cuba and [Best of OpenSource Technologies](http://www.bootev.org/) (BooT ev) from
Germany. And we were not **just** a bunch of nerds talking about
computers. No way! There were people from other fields like Culture,
Social Sciences and Health talking as well about how they use Free
Software on their day to day work.

The program covered a wide range of topics like programming, high
availability systems architecture, network privacy and anonymity,
cryptography, free culture, free society, and last but not least, women
inclusion in the free software movement, the challenges they face and how
they fight for their rights. Among the speakers we had people from
[Debian](http://www.debian.org), [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/), [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/),
and many other big players of the IT field.

We had the opportunity to give a lightning talk about Thunderbit. To our
joy, some people approached us later asking for details of the project and
giving us positive feedback. Thank you all!

We really had a great time and met a lot of amazing people. Now we are
looking forward to a **CubaConf 2017**. Will you join us next time?
